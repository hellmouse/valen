@1 = ~At last, the fiend is within our sight. Make ready, my friends!~
@2 = ~We're always ready, "Van". Overdramatic much?~
@3 = ~I just want you to appreciate the gravity of the situation. We have studied long and travelled far to smite this menace.~
@4 = ~Yes, yes, save the world, kill the vampires. Let's just get these bystanders out of the way and then move in for the kill.~
@5 = ~Ahem. Good <PRO_SIRMAAM>, you may not be aware of this, but that pale-looking lady travelling with you is a creature of darkness: a blood-sucking vampire.~
@6 = ~As servants of the Morninglord it is our duty and our calling to rid the world of such evil. However, the battle may be bloody. Please stand aside so that you won't be accidentally hurt in the coming melee.~

  @7 = ~Not a chance, fools. Valen works for me and enjoys the protection of my group.~
  @8 = ~I'm afraid that I cannot let you destroy her. Her nature is odious but her powers are necessary if I am to complete my quest.~
  @9 = ~Very well, I'll just step over here.~

@10 = ~<CHARNAME>, to whom are you speaking? I see no one. Tanova warned me of such things.~

@11 = ~Of course you don't see anyone, dear. You can't even hear me talking. We didn't get to be master vampire hunters by making amateurish mistakes.~
@12 = ~We are protected from undead. It's hardly sporting ... but then, neither is exchanging your soul for a hellish unlife powered by the blood of innocents. You and your kind are an abomination in the eyes of Lathander.~
@13 = ~So, "<CHARNAME>", will you stand aside?~

  @14 = ~Yes, I will not interfere.~
  @15 = ~No! I will fight you first!~

@16 = ~So be it. By allying yourself with a fiend like this you are forsaking your humanity. May the Morninglord have mercy on your soul.~
@17 = ~Thank you, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>. To arms!~
