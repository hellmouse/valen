@1 = ~Blighted by the Sun~
@2 = ~Valen's Armor~
@3 = ~Valen's Armor
Valen's shadowy armor was a gift from her Mistress in order to help her survive outside of the flock. It is light and flowing, more of a hooden ermine wrap than a true leather cuirass. Powerful unholy enchantments woven into the fabric prevent the true light of the sun from vaporizing Valen's vampiric flesh. She is still decidedly weakened under its glare, however. 

As a fledgling vampire, Valen has the standard undead immunities to hold, charm, death magic and poison. She is resistant to cold and electrical damage. She regenerates one hit point every two seconds.~

@15 = ~When asked about her past, VALEN gives you a strange smirk. She briefly elaborates that she was a full-time thug before she met her Mistress Bodhi. Under Bodhi's direction she learned the ways of the thief and when she was made a vampire her two sets of skills merged. Bodhi has commanded Valen to obey you, and she has so far ... but there is something disconcerting about her and her shifting loyalties.~
